<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="list-home">
   <li><strong>The brain is what counts, everything else is transport.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>I’m not a psychopath, I am a high functioning socio-path. Do your research.</strong></li>
<li><strong>I don’t have friends, I just have one.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Oh, I may be on the side of Angels, but don’t think for a second that I am one of them.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Bitterness is a paralytic. Love is a much more viscous motivator.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Once you rule out the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be true.</strong></li>
</ul>
